## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please let me know.
I'm going out on a limb here, it's contriverial, we don't have a country that is good at talking about money and finance unless its about real estate.
I'm trying to change that a little and just put some more options on the table to talk about if not consider.

I've seen so many posts on reddit and other places about how house prices are out of reach and how people are getting priced out of the market.
I was in the same boat and want to share some other options that I've come across.

If you find any errors, let me know, feel free to open an issue on github or submit a PR.
