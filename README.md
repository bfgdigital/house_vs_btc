# House vs Bitcoin Investment Calculator

## Purpose

This application aims to challenge traditional thinking about property investment being the only path to financial security. In Australia, discussing money and finance often defaults to real estate conversations, leaving other investment options unexplored. With housing affordability becoming increasingly challenging for many (particularly younger generations), this tool provides data-driven comparisons between traditional property investment and Bitcoin investment strategies.

The calculator isn't meant to suggest that one investment is definitively better than the other, but rather to encourage more open discussions about different investment approaches and financial futures.

## Overview

This interactive web application allows users to:
- Compare historical returns of property investment vs Bitcoin investment
- Explore different investment timeframes and scenarios
- Visualise the data through interactive charts and graphs
- Access historical price data for both assets

## Background

The inspiration for this tool came from observing widespread concerns about housing affordability across social media and news platforms. Many people express feelings of hopelessness about ever entering the property market (e.g., numerous discussions on Reddit: https://www.google.com/search?&q=depressed+about+australian+housing+market+reddit).

While property investment has traditionally been viewed as the primary path to wealth building, this tool aims to broaden the conversation by introducing alternative investment considerations.
